# Basic Card with Teams Deep Linking

## Summary

This example shows a basic ACE with a single card view. The settings allow you to set the link launched by the card. You can set the URL to anything you like and the card will launch it. For Teams links, paste in the link from "Get link to channel" and select the "Is Teams Deep Link".

Highlights:

- Basic properties and updating the property pane
- How link actions work and properties are accessed within a solution
- Updating the code to use async/await
