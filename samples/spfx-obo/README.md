# Using the Azure AD on-behalf-of flow within your SharePoint Framework solution

## Summary

This is a sample solution that illustrates how to invoke a middleware Web API/service, from a SharePoint Framework solution, relying on the On-Behalf-Of (OBO) flow in order to consume a backend Web API/service.

## Documentation
You can find additional technical details about the OBO grant flow reading the [Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 On-Behalf-Of flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) document.

## Prerequisites

The SPFx solution relies on a middleware APIs built with .NET 6. The source code of the APIs is available [here](./spfx-obo-middleware) in this repository. You will find two Azure Functions:
- *GetPersonalData*: takes care of retrieving current user's personal data (UPN and Inbox metrics) using On-Behalf-Of flow with explicit code in the function.
- *SendTEamsChatMessage*: takes care of sending a teams message in a 1:1 chat relying on some Azure Functions middleware extensions, in order to ease the development process of the function itself and to provide a reusable solution.

The SPFx solution is available [here](./spfx-obo-consumer) in this repository.
